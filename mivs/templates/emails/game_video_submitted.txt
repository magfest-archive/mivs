Your game ({{ game.title }}) has been submitted for review into the MAGFest Indie Videogame Showcase (MIVS).

During the week after Round 1 closes, we'll be reviewing your video.  Based on the judging of the video content, we'll inform you {{ c.VIDEO_RESPONSE_EXPECTED }} as to whether or not your game is accepted into Round 2, where a demo of the game itself will be judged.

All details, including Round 2, will be available on the FAQ at http://magfest.org/mivsfaq.  That page is updated as we progress through the judging, so be sure to check it for new content.

As always, you can continue managing your application at any time at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/mivs_applications/continue_app?id={{ game.studio.id }}
