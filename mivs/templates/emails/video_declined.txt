{{ game.studio.primary_contact.first_name }},

We're sorry but your Round 1 game entry ({{ game.title }}) in the MAGFest Indie Videogame Showcase (MIVS) was not accepted into Round 2.

But, while this means your studio is not eligible for a permanent spot in the MIVS area, it is still able to show at MIVS via our "Quickplay" section.  For a given window of time (e.g., 2 hours last year) indies were able to bring their games and show it off.  Pending availability, you're welcome to show in more than one window of time!

Details on the "Quickplay" section will be on the MIVS section of http://magfest.org/ at the top of February.
