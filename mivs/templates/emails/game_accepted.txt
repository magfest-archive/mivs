Congratulations!  Your game submission ({{ game.title }}) for the 2016 MAGFest Indie Videogame Showcase (MIVS) is one of the 55 that have been accepted into the showcase.

*** YOU NEED TO CONFIRM YOUR ACCEPTANCE! ***

Please confirm that you are coming OR let us know that you cannot make it after all at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/mivs_applications/continue_app?id={{ game.studio.id }}

You have until {{ c.MIVS_CONFIRM_DEADLINE|datetime }} to confirm.

We'd much rather you explicitly decline than to just fade, as being prompt helps us to move indies who are on the waitlist into the showcase.

More details will be sent out to all those who confirm including:
- Opportunity to buy a hotel room in the Gaylord (yes we saved a block for sale to the indies this year)
- What's included in a MIVS "booth" space
- much, much more....

Again, we understand that things may come up which may prevent your team from meeting the above requirements.  If this is the case, please let us know ASAP as this will allow one of our many wait-listed entries to participate.

Telling us you aren't able to meet the requirements leaves your team on good terms with the MIVS staff; failing to show or not meeting the requirements will be taken into consideration for future events.
