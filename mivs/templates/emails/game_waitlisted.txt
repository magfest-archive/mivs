{{ game.studio.primary_contact.first_name }},

Thank you for your game submission ({{ game.title }}) to the MAGFest Indie Videogame Showcase (MIVS).

Your studio's entry was judged high enough to qualify for the MIVS area but we do not have enough space to host your team, so we've added you to our Waitlist.

This means that if other indies who have been placed in MIVS end up not being able to show for any reason, we'll ask indies on the Waitlist as to their availability to take the spot.  If you know outright you can't attend, please let us know and we'll remove you from the Waitlist.  (We're sorry but we cannot give out details regarding size of the Waitlist or entry position.)

Alternatively you can also show at MAGFest even if you do not have a full-time MIVS booth area via "QuickPlay"!

QuickPlay is an area at MIVS where tables are set aside for indies to show their game for a block of time.  As an indie, you'll be able to sign up for a 2 hour block of time, with possibly more blocks depending on availability.  We will provide a table, 2 chairs, and power.  You will need to provide your own equipment.  (WIFI/Network connections will not be available.)

Signups for Quickplay will not happen online, they will only be available on-site at MAGFest in the MIVS area and will require you to have purchased a MAGFest badge.  Signups will be on a first come first serve basis, so we recommend visiting the MIVS area at your first convenience after picking up your MAGFest badge.
