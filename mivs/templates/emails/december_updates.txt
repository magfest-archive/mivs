3. *** MAGFest Versus! ****

MAGfest Versus! is a fan recreation of Nick Arcade, a 90’s show on Nickelodeon hat pitied contestants in tests of video game skill. We debuted Versus in September at MAGFest Laboratories, and hosting it again at Super MAGFest. You can view it on youtube: https://youtu.be/qXHILYLRklM

We're looking to independent games for our video challenges.  Do you think your MIVS game would create an awesome challenge for our contestants?  We're looking for local multiplayer or single player games that utilize a high score or has timers so we know which contestant completed a challenge faster.

If interested, your game must meet the following criteria:
- playable on Windows
- compatible with an XBOX 360 controller or compatible pc based controller 
- have a save state available (prefered) or fast loading times to get into play quickly.
- have high scores, times or some other goal that can be beaten in either 30 or 60 seconds

Please include a short biography about your studio, the game’s theme/story, and links to your webpage for attendees to get more information about you.
 
If you are interested in showcasing your game on our program, we’d love to hear from you. Please contact us at Gameshow@magfest.org no later than December 10th, at 11:59 p.m.
