Hello {{ judge.attendee.first_name }},

If you're receiving this, you've been selected to be a Judge for this year's MAGFest Indie Video Game Showcase. (MIVS) You should have already received an email with login information for your judging account.  

For helping us judge the entries to be shown for this year, we are happy to give you a free pass to MAGFest.  If you feel at any time that you are unable to complete your duties as a judge, everything will be fine as long as you let us known as soon as possible.

You can expect judging to start a few days after {{ c.ROUND_TWO_DEADLINE|datetime_local("%b %d") }}, as we assign out games to you. Judging will last until {{ c.JUDGING_DEADLINE|datetime_local }}. Be on the lookout for another email from us very soon that will contain more detailed instructions. 

If you have any questions, feel free to drop us a line at mivs@magfest.org
