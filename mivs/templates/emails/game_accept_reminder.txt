Congratulations again for your game submission ({{ game.title }}) being accepted into the {{ c.ESCHATON.year }} MAGFest Indie Videogame Showcase (MIVS).

You still haven't told us whether or not you accept the offer of a table in the showcase, which you may do at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/mivs_applications/continue_app?id={{ game.studio.id }}

You must accept or decline the space by {{ game.studio.confirm_deadline|datetime_local }}. Telling us you aren't able to meet the requirements leaves your team on good terms with the MIVS staff; failing to show or not meeting the requirements will be taken into consideration for future events.
