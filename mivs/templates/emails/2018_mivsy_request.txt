Hello MIVS Judges,

First, I would like to thank you all for helping us judge in order to determine who will be showing into the MagFest Indie Videogame Showcase. It is with your help that we are able to ensure that we bring the best indie games to MAGFest for all the attendees to enjoy.

Now that the games are judged and the showcase is being curated, I would like to ask you a question:

 Are you up for a new challenge?

Last year, we introduced MIVSYs, the MAGFest awards that are handed out to the best of the indie games and their developers. We handed out 7 awards and are planning on adding an additional 3 categories. In order to ensure the award selection is as fair and robust as possible, I come to you, our awesome judges. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to help us pick who will win a MIVSY.

There is no obligation to take part in judging the awards. Think of it an exciting side-quest where the reward is the undying love and gratitude of the MIVS staff.

If you are interested, please respond to this e-mail letting us know you are interested. We will be sending you an e-mail closer to the event with the finalized list of awards and how to fill out your judging card (these will be provided by the MIVS booth). If you are unable to judge, please feel free to disregard.
