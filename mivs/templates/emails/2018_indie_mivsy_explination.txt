Hello Indies,

We here at MIVS are so excited to see you and your games in less than month. Last year, we introduced the MIVSYs, MAGFest’s Indie Awards to be given out to the best of the best. This year, we made a couple changes along with a new addition. We will also be having a small, much less impromptu, awards ceremony on Saturday at 7:00 PM in the MIVS area.  

With that in mind, I would like to take this opportunity to announce the awards that will be handed out at this year’s MAGFest.


-Best in Show

Hey! You did the thing the best! This award is given out to the indie game considered to be the best of all games that were accepted into the Indie Game Showcase.

-Tones Award (Best Music)

Your music is aesthetically pleasing to the ear! This award is given out to the indie game considered to have the best music of all games that were accepted into the Indie Game Showcase. (Note: Some music may be on the loud side. We recommend bringing headphones for attendees so they can properly appreciate the dulcet tones of your game)

-Shiny! Award (Best Art)

Your game is pretty! This award is given out to the indie game considered to have the best artstyle of all games that were accepted into the Indie Game Showcase.

-Tronster Award (Best Booth/Rug)

Cool Booth, Broh! This award is given out to the indie game considered to have the best booth of all games that were accepted into the Indie Game Showcase. And remember kids, the most important piece when decorating any room is a good rug. 

-Tony Powell Award (Best Presence)

Your biggest asset when selling your game is a smile and winning personality. When that fails, I hear free stuff works! This award is given out to the indie game developer considered to have the best presence of all developers that were accepted into the Indie Game Showcase.

-Friends, Enemies and Frenemies Award

Sometimes, games bring you closer together. Others will tear you apart. Either way, you’re in for some entertainment. This award is given out to the best multiplayer game that was accepted into the Indie Game Showcase


If you have any questions regarding the awards, the ceremony, etc. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us and ask. Looking forward to seeing all you wonderful people at MAGFest!
