You're receiving this email as you've been selected to be a judge for the 2017 Magfest Indie Game Showcase. Most likely, you have been a judge with us in the past or this is your first time judging with us.

As a Judge, you'll be responsible for playing and judging up to ***13*** different games.  We're expecting judging to start right after October 10 and you'll have until October 30th to complete your assignments.  We've found in the past to expect to spend around 15 minutes per game to get an accurate assessment.  You'll be assigning games a score from 1 to 10, and can leave feedback for the developers.  As thanks for helping us, we'll be able to give you a complementary pass to MagFest 2017. If you've already bought a pass, get in touch and we'll take a look at what options are available for you.

We know it's a bit of a tighter window for judging this year and less of a heads up, but I hope you'll bear with us. If you find that you don't have time to complete your games, it's certainly ok! But please let us know sooner rather than later so that we can assign replacements in time.

From myself and everyone else on the MIVS team, we want to thank you for helping us and the independent developers who rely on us.  It's thanks to your efforts that we're able to have an amazing showcase year after year.

Be on the lookout for another email from as we approach October 10th, and please reach out if you have any questions.
